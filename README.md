# Brief Intro to Use of Cheat Code：
Cheat code could be entered anytime when you take the control and could input anything from the keyboard. Cheat code will only be recognized if you enter them as a single phrase (or you could try). (ex: BlackSheepWall would be accepted, but "@#$BlackSheepWall@$$" or "Black Sheep Wall" wouldn't.)


# Cheat Code List:
BlackSheepWall: shows you the graph of resource/monster position of the current area you're at
ShowMeTheFlower: adds 10 flowers to your bag of items
